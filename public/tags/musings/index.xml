      <description>Itâ€™s a bliss to be surrounded by people whom you love.
How irritating would it be to get messages all day long (why wouldnâ€™t the other person just stop texting?) and then all of a sudden someone (whom you might have studied with) calls you, goes on to speak for an hour â€“ on various matters that you are least interested in and somehow at some point of time you run out of topic, you expect a halt, but your friend would never stop, adds a couple of his other friends to the line, speaks for yet another hour on what the ruling party has done to the country â€“ ah, a classic topic to discuss!</description>

      <description>Ah, my first blog!
This absurd idea of mine â€“ of writing a blog, has been haunting me since my school days. But several factors kept me away from writing one. This included my ardent desire to remain unnoticed (call it lack of confidence, shyness or whatever but I call it humility ðŸ˜…), lack of certainty (of literally everything! What am I supposed to write? Am I capable of convincing others through my blogs?</description>
